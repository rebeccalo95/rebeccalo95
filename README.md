## Origin of this GitHub ##
This GitHub account was created as a requirement for a compulsory task in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/bootcamps/web-development/" > HyperionDev Web Development Bootcamp </a> I enrolled in between Nov 2022 to Feb 2023. I started this bootcamp out of an interest in UI design and programming, hoping to learn more about how to create a functional website. My intention following this bootcamp is to work on the skills I have gained and use this GitHub account to store my portfolio.
