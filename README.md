## Origin of this GitHub ##
This GitHub account was originally created as a requirement for a compulsory task in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/bootcamps/web-development/" > HyperionDev Web Development Bootcamp </a> I enrolled in between Nov 2022 to Feb 2023. I started this bootcamp out of an interest in UI design and programming, hoping to learn more about how to create a functional website and become a full stack developer. Since the bootcamp ended, I have used my GitHub account to work on my skills and build on personal projects.
